As part of the [Codebascis](https://codebasics.io/challenge/codebasics-resume-project-challenge) resume project challenge, I've created a dashboard
### The Challenge 🏆

The challenge is about the imaginary company called AtliQ Grands which owns multiple Five-Star hotels across India. AtilQ Grands is losing business to competitors due to their management’s ineffective decision-making.

Now AtliQ Grands is losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. The revenue management team has decided to use Business and Data intelligence to identify the gaps and make decisions accordingly.

They are looking for a Data Analyst who can provide them with the relevant insights to help them solve this problem.

### Tasks :bookmark:

1. Create the metrics according to the metric list.
2. Create a dashboard according to the mock-up provided by stakeholders.
3. Create relevant insights that are not provided in the metric list/mock-up dashboard.
